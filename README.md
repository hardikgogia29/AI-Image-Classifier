# AI-Image-Classifier

## AI Image Classifier
This project is a deep learning-based image classifier that distinguishes between real and AI-generated (synthetic) images using the CIFAKE dataset from Kaggle. It demonstrates data handling, model training, and evaluation using modern deep learning frameworks.

## Dataset
Source: CIFAKE - Real and AI Generated Synthetic Images: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images/data

## Classes:

REAL: Real-world images

FAKE: AI-generated (synthetic) images

## Split:

Train: 50,000 REAL + 50,000 FAKE

Test: 10,000 REAL + 10,000 FAKE

## Libraries Used
